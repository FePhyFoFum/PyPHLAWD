There will be another big push for adding analyses and enhancements to input and output coming up (details [here](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/PyPHLAWD/projects)). If you have any requests, throw then into [issues](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/PyPHLAWD/issues) and on labels, put `enhancements` or note it in the text. I will associate it with the _big push 2_ project and things will start to get incorporated.
