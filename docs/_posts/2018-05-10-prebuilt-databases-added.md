While you can always build your own GenBank databases (with [phlawd_db_maker](https://github.com/blackrim/phlawd_db_maker)). There are some prebuilt databases that have been added [here](http://141.211.236.35:10998/). They are big files, so beware! But they can save you a bit of time making your own (or compiling phlawd_db_maker).
