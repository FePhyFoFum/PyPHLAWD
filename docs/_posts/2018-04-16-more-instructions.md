Several things have been added to the [installation](https://fephyfofum.github.io/PyPHLAWD/install/), [runs](https://fephyfofum.github.io/PyPHLAWD/runs/), and [scripts](https://fephyfofum.github.io/PyPHLAWD/scripts/). More is being added every few days. 

One notable addition is that in the installation section, we have added some instructions to using virtualenv that can be helpful for clusters and other systems where you don't want to mess with the standard python system.
