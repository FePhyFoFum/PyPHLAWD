PyPHLAWD has now officially moved to Python 3. This means that if you were previously using the python 2 version, you can still do that but if you update (`git pull` or download a new copy) it will need Python 3. The library requirements are the same you will just need Python 3 versions (which means that you will probably install with `pip3 install clint` and so on). If you note any bugs or issues, please post them on [github](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/PyPHLAWD/issues).
