# Bait Run Example

The files necessary to run this example can be found in the `examples/baited` directory. There is a `baits` directory with a few sequences (not comprehensive) for `ITS`, `matK`, `rbcL`, and `trnLF`. With this example, we will conduct a baited run for PyPHLAWD on the `Dipsacales` plant clade. 

## Setting things up

We are going to assume that you have already installed everything. This animation below starts from cloning the repo but assumes that all the dependencies are installed.
