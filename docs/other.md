### Using your own sequences
Coming soon! The idea here is to be able to either supplement the NCBI sequences or to conduct your own analysis entirely of your own sequences. To do this, you will still want to create your own database of the sequences using the table structure already in use with the `phlawd_db_maker`. 

To add your own sequences to an analysis, regardless of whether they are supplemental or not, you will want to add your sequences to the database. You can have this data in two forms: one file per taxon with sequence data in a fasta format in that file or one file with format `>taxon_name@seq_id`.
